Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) employs a combination of congestion detection and congestion control mechanisms to manage network congestion. These mechanisms work together to ensure efficient and reliable data transfer over a network. Here's an overview of TCP congestion detection and congestion control, explained in steps:

1. **Slow Start:**
- Initially, TCP starts in a "slow start" phase, where it gradually increases the amount of data it sends.
- The sender begins by sending a small number of segments (packets) and doubles the number of segments for each acknowledgment received.

2. **Congestion Window:**
- TCP maintains a variable called the "Congestion Window" (cwnd), which represents the number of unacknowledged segments that can be in transit at a given time.
- The congestion window is dynamically adjusted based on the network conditions.

3. **Congestion Avoidance:**
- As the congestion window increases, TCP transitions from slow start to "congestion avoidance" phase.
- In this phase, the sender increases the congestion window more slowly, usually by adding one segment per round-trip time.

4. **Timeouts and Retransmissions:**
- TCP uses timeouts to detect lost or delayed packets. If an acknowledgment is not received within a certain time frame, the sender assumes a packet is lost and retransmits it.
- The sender may also perform retransmissions if it receives three duplicate acknowledgments (indicating that the receiver has received the same packet multiple times).

5. **Triple Duplicate Acknowledgment (Fast Retransmit):**
- If the sender receives three duplicate acknowledgments for the same data, it assumes that a packet was lost and performs a fast retransmit by retransmitting the missing packet without waiting for a timeout.

6. **Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN):**
- ECN is a mechanism that allows routers to notify endpoints of impending congestion without dropping packets.
- TCP can respond to ECN signals by reducing its transmission rate.

7. **Congestion Window Reduction:**
- Upon detecting congestion through packet loss or ECN signals, TCP reduces its congestion window to alleviate network congestion.
- The reduction is typically more aggressive during packet loss events.

8. **Fast Recovery:**
- After detecting congestion and reducing the congestion window, TCP enters a "fast recovery" phase.
- During this phase, TCP continues sending new data but at a reduced rate. It uses duplicate acknowledgments to determine when to exit the fast recovery phase.

9. **Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease:**
- TCP uses an "additive increase, multiplicative decrease" approach to adjust the congestion window.
- When things are going well, TCP gradually increases the congestion window. On the other hand, when congestion is detected, TCP rapidly reduces the congestion window to alleviate the network.

By combining these mechanisms, TCP dynamically adjusts its transmission behavior based on the network conditions, aiming to provide reliable and efficient data transfer while adapting to varying levels of congestion.


"Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease" is a fundamental principle used in many congestion control algorithms, including those implemented in TCP. This principle governs how a network protocol adjusts its behavior in response to varying network conditions to achieve stability and fairness. Let's break down the terms:

1. **Additive Increase (AI):**
- During periods of relative network calmness, when the protocol perceives that the network has sufficient capacity and congestion is not a major issue, it incrementally increases its sending rate.
- The increase is typically linear or additive. For example, in TCP, the congestion window size is increased by a constant amount for each round-trip time without congestion events.
- This gradual approach helps the protocol to explore available bandwidth without causing abrupt or drastic changes.

2. **Multiplicative Decrease (MD):**
- When the protocol detects congestion, it responds more aggressively by reducing its transmission rate. This reduction is often proportional to the perceived level of congestion.
- The decrease is typically multiplicative or exponential. For example, in TCP, when packet loss occurs (indicating network congestion), the congestion window size is reduced by half.
- The multiplicative decrease aims to alleviate congestion quickly and avoid exacerbating the problem by sharply reducing the amount of data sent.

The combination of additive increase and multiplicative decrease is designed to achieve stability in network behavior:
- **Additive Increase:** Gradually explore and increase the data transmission rate when the network is operating smoothly.
- **Multiplicative Decrease:** Quickly respond to congestion by significantly reducing the transmission rate, preventing further exacerbation of network congestion.

This approach is part of a broader strategy known as AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease), and it helps TCP, and other protocols using similar congestion control mechanisms, to adapt to varying network conditions, efficiently utilize available bandwidth, and share network resources fairly with other competing connections.

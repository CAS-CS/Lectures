# Q 3

Attempt any TWO questions from three of the following.
#### (i) A dice is thrown 10,000 times and a 1 or 6 is observed 4,540 times. Show that the dice cannot be regarded as an unbiased one and find the limits between the probability of a throw 1 or 6?
#### (ii) Define Scaling and Scaling techniques ?
#### (iii) Explain different categories in WoS and how is impact-factor calculated? An author has published 10 articles and has received citations as given below, define his h-index and i10-index?
Citations = {99, 9, 10, 15, 12, 18, 10 , 25, 8, 20, 5, 14, 22}.


# Hints
(i) **Dice Probability:**
To check if the dice is unbiased, we can perform a hypothesis test. Let \( p \) be the probability of getting a 1 or 6 in a single throw of an unbiased die. The null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) is that the die is unbiased (\( p = 1/3 \)), and the alternative hypothesis (\( H_1 \)) is that the die is biased (\( p \neq 1/3 \)).

Let \( X \) be the number of times 1 or 6 is observed in 10,000 throws. For a fair die, \( X \) should follow a binomial distribution with parameters \( n = 10,000 \) and \( p = 1/3 \).

Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution (since \( n \) is large), calculate the standard error \( SE \):
\[ SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \]

Calculate the z-score:
\[ Z = \frac{(X/n) - p}{SE} \]

If \( |Z| \) is significantly different from zero, it suggests that the die is biased.

To find the limits between the probability of a throw being 1 or 6:
\[ p \pm Z \times SE \]

(ii) **Scaling and Scaling Techniques:**
### **Scaling:** It is the process of assigning numbers to objects or events according to specific rules, making it possible to quantify and compare them.

### **Scaling Techniques:**
##### ***Ordinal Scaling:** Orders items based on a characteristic without specifying the intervals between them.
##### ***Interval Scaling:** Preserves the order and specifies the intervals between items but lacks a true zero point.
##### ***Ratio Scaling:** Preserves order, specifies intervals, and has a true zero point.

(iii) **WoS Categories and Impact Factor:**
### **WoS (Web of Science) Categories:**
- WoS categorizes journals into subject areas like Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, and Arts & Humanities Citation Index.

### **Impact Factor Calculation:**
- It is the average number of citations received per article in a particular journal during a specific time.
- \[ \text{Impact Factor} = \frac{\text{Total Citations}}{\text{Number of Articles Published}} \]
- Higher impact factors generally indicate greater influence.

### **Author's h-Index and i10-Index:**
##### ***h-Index:** The author has an h-index of 8 if they have 8 papers, each cited at least 8 times.
##### ***i10-Index:** The author has an i10-index of 7 if they have 7 papers with at least 10 citations each.
- These indices measure both productivity and impact, providing a balanced assessment of an author's research output.

# Q 4
Attempt any ONE question from two of the following.
#### (i) What are the measures of dispersion? Describe levels of measurements? What are Sampling and Non-sampling errors?
#### (ii) How will you verify Journal indexing? What are predatory Journals? How might plagiarism impact your academic and professional reputation? Rules for writing hypothesis and explain Type I error in hypothesis testing?
# Hints
(i) **Measures of Dispersion, Levels of Measurement, Sampling, and Non-Sampling Errors:**

### **Measures of Dispersion:**
1. **Range:** The difference between the maximum and minimum values.
1. **Variance:** The average of the squared differences from the mean.
1. **Standard Deviation:** The square root of the variance.
1. **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The range between the first and third quartiles.

### **Levels of Measurement:**
1. **Nominal:** Categorical data without any order (e.g., colors).
1. **Ordinal:** Categorical data with a meaningful order (e.g., education levels).
1. **Interval:** Numerical data with equal intervals but no true zero point (e.g., temperature in Celsius).
1. **Ratio:** Numerical data with equal intervals and a true zero point (e.g., height, weight).

### **Sampling and Non-Sampling Errors:**
##### ***Sampling Error:** The difference between the sample result and the true population parameter due to random chance. It can be reduced by increasing sample size.
##### ***Non-Sampling Error:** Errors not related to the act of sampling, including measurement errors, data processing errors, and non-response bias.

(ii) **Verifying Journal Indexing, Predatory Journals, and Plagiarism Impact:**

### **Verifying Journal Indexing:**
- Check the journal's website and publisher for indexing information.
- Use reputable indexing databases like PubMed, Scopus, or Web of Science.

### **Predatory Journals:**
- Journals that exploit the open-access publishing model for financial gain without providing rigorous peer review.
- Lack of transparency, poor quality control, and questionable ethical standards.

### **Plagiarism Impact:**
##### ***Academic Reputation:** Diminished academic credibility, loss of trust, and potential expulsion or academic penalties.
##### ***Professional Reputation:** Damaged professional standing, job loss, and legal consequences.

### **Rules for Writing Hypotheses and Type I Error:**
##### ***Hypothesis Writing Rules:**
1. *Clearly state null and alternative hypotheses.
1. *Be specific about the expected relationship.
1. *Use clear and measurable variables.
1. *Ensure testability and feasibility.

##### ***Type I Error (False Positive):**
- Occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true.
- The probability of Type I error is denoted by alpha (\( \alpha \)).
- Controlling Type I error is crucial in hypothesis testing to avoid making incorrect conclusions.

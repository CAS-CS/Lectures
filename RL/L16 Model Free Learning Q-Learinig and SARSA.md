# Model-free learning

Model-free learning is a category of reinforcement learning where the agent learns to make decisions without having a complete model of the environment. In model-free learning, the agent learns from interacting with the environment and doesn't explicitly know the transition probabilities or the reward function. Two popular model-free learning algorithms are Q-learning and SARSA.

### **Q-learning:**

1. **Objective:** Q-learning is used to learn the optimal action-value function, denoted as \(Q(s, a)\), where \(s\) is the state, and \(a\) is the action. The optimal Q-function represents the expected cumulative reward of taking action \(a\) in state \(s\) and then following the optimal policy thereafter.

2. **Update Rule:** The Q-learning update rule is given by:
   \[Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\right]\]
   where \(\alpha\) is the learning rate, \(r\) is the immediate reward, \(\gamma\) is the discount factor, \(s'\) is the next state, and \(a'\) is the action in the next state.

### **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action):**
   
1. **Objective:** Similar to Q-learning, SARSA is used to learn the action-value function, but it learns the value of the current action in the current state and the action to be taken in the next state.
2. **Update Rule:** The SARSA update rule is given by:
     \[Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\right]\]
     where \(s'\) is the next state, \(a'\) is the action in the next state.

#### Differences:

- Q-learning is an off-policy method, meaning it learns the value of the optimal policy while following a different, exploratory policy (e.g., epsilon-greedy).
- SARSA is an on-policy method, meaning it learns the value of the policy it is currently following.
- The update rule for Q-learning involves the maximum Q-value over possible next actions, while the SARSA update uses the actual action taken in the next state.

#### Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:

- Both Q-learning and SARSA involve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. The epsilon-greedy strategy is often used, where the agent with probability \(1 - \epsilon\) chooses the action with the highest Q-value, and with probability \(\epsilon\), it explores by choosing a random action.

>  These model-free learning algorithms are widely used in practice for decision-making in reinforcement learning scenarios where the environment is not fully known in advance. They are particularly useful in situations where the dynamics of the environment are complex or unknown.

# Scaling up RL
Scaling up reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation and imitation learning in large spaces involves addressing the challenges that arise when dealing with high-dimensional state and action spaces. This is a critical aspect of RL, especially in real-world applications where the state and action spaces can be vast and continuous.

### 1. **Scaling up RL with Function Approximation:**
- **Challenge:** Traditional RL algorithms may struggle when dealing with large state or action spaces, as maintaining a table to represent the value function or policy becomes impractical due to the sheer number of possible combinations.
- **Solution:** Function approximation techniques are employed to generalize learning from a subset of the state or action space to the entire space. This involves using function approximators, such as neural networks, to represent the value function or policy. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a popular approach that utilizes deep neural networks for function approximation.
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** In the context of Q-learning, DQN is an example of scaling up RL with function approximation. It uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function, enabling it to handle high-dimensional state spaces.

### 2. **Imitation Learning in Large Spaces:**
- **Challenge:** Learning directly from RL in large spaces can be sample-inefficient and time-consuming. Imitation learning, also known as learning from demonstrations, addresses this challenge by leveraging expert demonstrations to guide the learning process.
- **Solution:** Instead of starting RL from scratch, the agent is trained by imitating the behavior of an expert or a set of expert demonstrations. This can significantly accelerate learning, especially in situations where obtaining samples from the environment is costly or time-consuming.
- **Behavioral Cloning:** One simple form of imitation learning involves training a model to mimic the actions of an expert based on observed state-action pairs. The agent learns a policy that approximates the expert's behavior.

#### **Challenges in Scaling Up:**
- **Exploration-Exploitation:** Balancing exploration and exploitation becomes crucial in large state spaces. Techniques like epsilon-greedy strategies or more sophisticated exploration policies are used.
- **Sample Efficiency:** Training in large spaces often requires a large number of samples, making sample efficiency a critical concern. Techniques like experience replay (used in DQN) or advanced algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) aim to address this issue.
- **Generalization:** Ensuring that the learned policy generalizes well to unseen states is essential. Function approximation techniques, regularization methods, and diverse training data contribute to better generalization.

#### **Applications:**
- Scaling up RL with function approximation and imitation learning has found applications in various domains, including robotics, autonomous systems, and complex decision-making tasks, where dealing with large and continuous state and action spaces is common.

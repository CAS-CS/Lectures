# Microprocessor 8085/8086:
The 8085 and 8086 are microprocessors developed by Intel. They are part of the x86 family of processors and have been widely used in various applications. Here's a brief overview:

- **8085**: The 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in 1976. It has a 16-bit address bus and an 8-bit data bus, capable of addressing up to 64 KB of memory. The 8085 features various registers, including accumulator, general-purpose registers, stack pointer, and program counter. It also supports a range of instructions for arithmetic, logical, and control operations.

- **8086**: The 8086 is a 16-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in 1978. It has a 20-bit address bus and a 16-bit data bus, capable of addressing up to 1 MB of memory. The 8086 offers enhanced performance compared to the 8085 and supports more advanced instructions and addressing modes.

### Operations and Basic Interfacing Concepts:
- **Operations**: Microprocessors perform various operations such as arithmetic, logic, data transfer, and control operations. These operations are executed based on instructions fetched from memory and decoded by the microprocessor.
- **Basic Interfacing Concepts**: Interfacing involves connecting external devices such as memory, input/output devices, and sensors to the microprocessor. Basic interfacing concepts include address decoding, data transfer protocols, and control signals generation to communicate with external devices.

### Memory Interfacing:
Memory interfacing involves connecting memory devices such as RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory) to the microprocessor. Key aspects of memory interfacing include addressing, data transfer, and control signals generation. Techniques like memory-mapped I/O and I/O-mapped I/O are used to access memory and I/O devices.

### ADC/DAC:
- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**: ADCs convert analog signals into digital data that can be processed by the microprocessor. They sample the analog signal at regular intervals and produce digital output proportional to the input voltage.
- **DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)**: DACs convert digital data into analog signals. They accept digital input from the microprocessor and produce analog output voltage or current.


### Types of ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter):

#### 1. Successive Approximation ADC:
- **Principle**: Utilizes a binary search algorithm to approximate the input voltage.
- **Formula**: The conversion time for an N-bit successive approximation ADC can be approximated by:
  \[ T_{\text{conv}} = N \times T_{\text{clk}} \]
- **Example**: An 8-bit successive approximation ADC with a clock period of 1 microsecond (\( T_{\text{clk}} = 1 \mu s \)) would have a conversion time of \( 8 \times 1 \mu s = 8 \mu s \).

#### 2. Flash ADC:
- **Principle**: Employs a set of voltage comparators to generate digital outputs directly.
- **Formula**: The number of comparators required in a flash ADC is \( 2^N - 1 \), where \( N \) is the number of bits.
- **Example**: A 4-bit flash ADC requires \( 2^4 - 1 = 15 \) comparators.

#### 3. Delta-Sigma ADC:
- **Principle**: Converts analog signals into digital form by oversampling and noise shaping.
- **Formula**: The resolution of a delta-sigma ADC is given by the oversampling ratio.
- **Example**: A delta-sigma ADC with an oversampling ratio of 64 achieves an effective resolution of \( \log_2(64) = 6 \) bits.

### Types of DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter):

#### 1. Binary Weighted Resistor DAC:
- **Principle**: Uses a series of resistor values weighted in binary progression.
- **Formula**: The output voltage of a binary weighted resistor DAC can be calculated as:
  \[ V_{\text{out}} = (D_{N-1} \times 2^{N-1} + D_{N-2} \times 2^{N-2} + \cdots + D_1 \times 2^1 + D_0 \times 2^0) \times \frac{V_{\text{ref}}}{2^N} \]
- **Example**: For a 4-bit binary weighted resistor DAC with \( V_{\text{ref}} = 5 \) V and digital input 1010, the output voltage would be:
  \[ V_{\text{out}} = (1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0) \times \frac{5}{2^4} = (8 + 0 + 2 + 0) \times \frac{5}{16} = 10 \times \frac{5}{16} = 3.125 \] V

#### 2. R-2R Ladder DAC:
- **Principle**: Employs a network of resistors in a ladder configuration, simplifying the resistor values.
- **Formula**: The output voltage of an R-2R ladder DAC can be expressed as a weighted sum of the digital input bits.
- **Example**: Similar to the binary weighted DAC, the R-2R ladder DAC output voltage can be calculated using the formula based on the digital input.

### Serial and Parallel Data Communication Interfacing:
- **Serial Communication**: In serial communication, data is transmitted one bit at a time over a single communication channel. Common serial communication interfaces include UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface).
- **Parallel Communication**: In parallel communication, multiple bits are transmitted simultaneously over multiple communication lines. Parallel communication interfaces include parallel ports, parallel buses like the ISA bus, and parallel communication protocols.

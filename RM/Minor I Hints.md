## Q
Write a progarm in LaTeX to draw following in same figure.
(a) 1 cm square with a point at (0,0) having red color
(b) circle or radius 2cm centering at (1,1) with label “r=1cm” at the
center and
(c) 1cm line starting at point (2,2) at an angle 30 degree ?
Also explain use of \for each.
### A
Certainly! Below is a simple LaTeX program using the TikZ package to draw a 1 cm square with a red point at (0,0), a circle of radius 2 cm centered at (1,1) with a label, and a 1 cm line starting at (2,2) at an angle of 30 degrees.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
     % (a) 1 cm square with a red point at (0,0)
    \draw (0,0) rectangle (1,1);
    \fill[red] (0,0) circle (2pt);
     % (b) Circle of radius 2 cm centered at (1,1)
    \draw (1,1) circle (2cm);
    \node at (1,1) {r=2cm}; % Label at the center
     % (c) 1 cm line starting at (2,2) at an angle 30 degrees
    \draw (2,2) -- ++(30:1cm);
 \end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Various Shapes}
\end{figure}

\end{document}
```

Explanation:

1. `\begin{tikzpicture} ... \end{tikzpicture}`: This environment is used to create a TikZ picture.

2. `\draw (x1,y1) rectangle (x2,y2);`: Draws a rectangle with the specified coordinates.

3. `\fill[red] (x,y) circle (radius);`: Fills a circle with a specified color at the given coordinates.

4. `\draw (x,y) circle (radius);`: Draws a circle with the specified radius at the given coordinates.

5. `\node at (x,y) {label};`: Places a node with a label at the specified coordinates.

6. `\draw (x1,y1) -- ++(angle:distance);`: Draws a line starting at (x1, y1) and extending in the specified direction (angle) for a specified distance.

The `\foreach` loop is not explicitly used in this example, but it is a powerful command in TikZ for repeating certain elements in a drawing. It allows you to iterate over a range of values and perform actions for each value. In more complex drawings, `\foreach` can be handy for generating repetitive patterns or structures.

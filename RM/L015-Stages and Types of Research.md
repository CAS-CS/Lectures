# Stages of research methodology

1. **Interest**:  Narrow area of research 

1. **Formulating and Clarifying :** Identifying and Defining problem or problem statement.

1. **Reviewing Litrature**: Identify State-of-the-Art.

1. **Desing the research**: Define how to collect data, where from, who will respond.

1. **Data collection**: Survey, Experimentation readings, observations, design, etc.

1. **Analysing data**: Compile data, Performance analysis, and generate meaning full results.

1. **Writing**: Write report of findings. Structured according to type, ie. letter, article, desertation, thesis, bookchapter, or book.

# Important factors to consider:
- Avoide researchers bias

- Data access, ownership, usage rights and restrictions. 

- Time & other limited resources. ***Plan your timeline for different stages of research***

- Validity and reliability of the data: careful experimental recordings, no data tampering.

- Ethical issues:
   1. No harm to nature, plants, animals or humans.
   1. Plagarisim, self-plagarisim, proper citation.

# Types of research methodology

One of the most important decision is to select which methodology to use for your research problem, 
### Types of Research  

1. Fundamental (Basic or pure) or Applied
1. Descriptive vs. Analytical
1. Conceptual vs Emperical
2. Qualitative, Quantitative or a combination of the two. 

No matter the type of research, *the data gathered will be as numbers or descriptions*, and **researchers can choose to focus on collecting words, numbers or both**.

# Fundamental research

* Gathering knowledge for knowledge's sake, hence, termed "pure" or "basic".

* Usually done in universities.

* Research concerning about natual phenomenon, or pure mathematics.

* Study of humans to make generalisations about human behaviour.

* **However, study of human behaviour for *specific social or business problem*,** 
ie:
1. Facebook addictive behaviour analysis, 
1. Amazon shopping pattern analysis, etc.
    
> The study of human behaviour **to apply it for specific purpose** is considered as **Applied research**



---

# Applied research

Applied research aims at **finding a solution for an immediate problem** facing a society or an industrial/business organisation. ie.
* Corona Vaccination.

1. Limited time
1. The central aim of applied research is to discover a solution for some pressing practical problem.
1. Its outcome has some specific application.

#   Descriptive vs Analytical

| Descriptive |  Analytical|
|:---| :---|
| -  | |
|Includes surveys and fact-finding enquiries |Use facts or information already available|
| -  | |
|*Ex post facto* :the researcher has no control over the variables||
| -  | |
| Researcher can only report what has happened or what is happening | Analyze available info to make a critical evaluation of the material. | 
|ie. Social science, ecnomics and business research ||


---
# Conceptual vs Emperical

- ***Conceptual research*** is related to some abstract idea(s) or theory.
    * Generally used by thinkers and philosophers, to develop new concepts or to reinterpret existing ones.

- ***Emperical research*** relies on experience or observetion alone, often without due regard for system theory.
    * It is based on data and can be varified by observation or experiment.

# Qualitative

Qualitative research involves **collecting and analyzing** written or spoken words and textual data. 

It may also focus on body language or visual elements and help to create a detailed description of a researcher's observations. 

Researchers usually gather qualitative data through **interviews, observation** and focus groups using a few carefully chosen participants.

This research methodology is **subjective and more time-consuming** than using quantitative data. 

Researchers often use a qualitative methodology when the aims and objectives of the research are **exploratory**. 
 
*For example*, **when they perform research to understand human perceptions regarding an event, person or product.**





---

# Quantitative

Researchers usually use a quantitative methodology when the objective of the research is to confirm something. 

It focuses on collecting, testing and measuring numerical data, usually from a large sample of participants. 

They then analyze the data using statistical analysis and comparisons. Popular methods used to gather quantitative data are:

*   Surveys
*   Questionnaires
*   Test
*   Databases
*   Organizational records
  
This is often quicker.

#  Mixed-method

This contemporary research methodology combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide additional perspectives, create a richer picture and present multiple findings. 

The quantitative methodology provides definitive facts and figures, while the qualitative provides a human aspect. 

This methodology can produce interesting results as it presents exact data while also being exploratory.

# Empirical research

> It is derived from the greek word **empeirikos** which means “experienced”

Empirical research is defined as any research where conclusions of the study is strictly drawn from concretely empirical **evidence**, and therefore are **“verifiable”** evidence.

> "I will not believe it unless I see it"

> *This came from the ancient empiricists, a fundamental understanding that powered the emergence of medieval science during the renaissance period and laid the foundation of modern science, as we know it today.*

---

# Deductive vs Inductive research

> Deductive 

* Develope a hypothesis based on existing theory, and then designing a research strategy to test the hypothesis
* Deductive approach is concerned with deducting conclusions from premises or propositions.

> Inductive

* Inductive approach starts with the observations and theories are proposed towards the end of the research process as a result of observations
* It involves the search for pattern from observation and the development of explanations, theories for those patterns through series of hypotheses.

> *No theories or hypotheses would apply in inductive studies at the beginning of the research and the researcher is free in terms of altering the direction for the study after the research process had commenced.*

# Criteria of Good Research

1. The **purpose** of the research should be **clearly defined**.

2. The **research procedure used should be described in sufficient detail to permit another researcher to repeat** the research for further advancement

3. The procedural design of the research should be carefully planned to yield results that are
   as objective as possible.

4. The researcher should **report their short commings**, like flaws in their design, human error, etc.

5. The validity and reliability of the data
   should be checked carefully.

6. Conclusions should be confined to those **justified by the data**.

### ***Good research is systematic, logical, empirical, and replicable.***

# Problems Encountered by Researchers in India

1. The lack of a scientific training in the methodology of research

2. Insufficient interaction between the university, business, government.

3. Business do not trust researchers with their data.

4. No assistance for clerical work.

5. Library mismanagement and lack of access to journals and books.
